1.  What is Peony ?

  Peony is an open-source file manager and graphical shell being
  developed by Eazel, Inc. and others. It is part of the UKUI project, and its
  source code can be found in the UKUI CVS repository. Peony is still in
  the early stages of development. It will become an integral part of the
  UKUI desktop environment when it is finished.
